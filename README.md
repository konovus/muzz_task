Interview task for Muzz

The app is written with MVVM architecture, using single activity pattern,
with Jetpack architecture components like Navigation, Room, Livedata, Flow, Coroutines.
The recyclerview was done with Epoxy.

I needed around 4 hours to write the app, and another 2-3 hours of debugging,
because getting the recyclerview to be scrolled at the bottom at all instances was troublesome.

I had about 2 hours spare per day for the task, so that's why it took so long.
If given more time i would definitely implement a paging adapter, to keep chunks of 30-50 messages 
loaded at a given time.
